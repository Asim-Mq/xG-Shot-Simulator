# Expected Goals (xG) Shot Simulator

An interactive tool that simulates football shot scenarios and calculates expected goals (xG) using a machine learning model trained on real shot data.

## Overview

This project visualizes and calculates xG values for football shots using a simple and intuitive web interface. Users can click on a pitch to simulate shots and receive live xG feedback, helping them understand shot quality based on position and context.

## Features

- Interactive pitch canvas using Streamlit
- Predictive xG model using Logistic Regression
- Real-time xG calculation based on user inputs
- Shot history display and cumulative xG score
- Supports context options like foot used, assist, and big chance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Pillow (for image handling)
- `xg_model.pkl` â€“ trained logistic regression model
